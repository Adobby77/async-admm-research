# Implementation Plan - Async Distributed ADMM (Paper Implementation)

Based on the provided snippets from "Asynchronous Distributed Multi-Robot Motion Planning Under Imperfect Communication", I will implement the **Delay-Aware Consensus ADMM** algorithm.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> I will simplify the problem to **Trajectory Optimization with Consensus** (e.g., Rendezvous or Formation) to demonstrate the algorithm without the complexity of non-convex collision avoidance constraints, which often require specialized solvers. The focus is on verifying equations (16) - (25).

## Proposed Changes

### New Files

#### [NEW] [async_admm_paper.py](file:///home/sriv/async_admm_paper.py)
- **Class `Agent`**:
    - Stores local trajectory $x_i$ and copies of neighbors $\tilde{x}_j$.
    - Stores dual variables $y, \lambda$.
    - **Local Solver**: Solves Eq (17) using `scipy.optimize.minimize`.
        - Cost: $J_i + \text{ADMM penalties}$.
        - ADMM penalties are weighted by $\rho$ (Eq 16).
- **Class `AsyncSimulator`**:
    - Manages the network of agents.
    - **Message Passing**: Simulates delays $d_{ij}$ and packet drops.
    - **Global Update**: Implements Eq (23) (Weighted average of received trajectories).
    - **Dual Update**: Implements Eq (24, 25).
    - **Adaptive Penalty**: Calculates $\rho_{ij}$ based on delay (Eq 16).

#### [NEW] [demo_async_paper.py](file:///home/sriv/demo_async_paper.py)
- **Scenario**: 3 Agents trying to reach a consensus configuration (e.g., meeting at a point or simple formation) while subject to communication delays.
- **Comparison**:
    1.  **Standard ADMM**: Fixed $\rho$, ignores delay (naively applies updates).
    2.  **Proposed Async ADMM**: Adaptive $\rho$ based on delay (Eq 16).
- **Visualization**:
    - Convergence plots (Primal Residual vs Iteration).
    - Trajectory evolution animation (optional or static plot).

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `demo_async_paper.py`.
- **Expected Result**: The "Proposed Async ADMM" should show more stable or faster convergence compared to "Standard ADMM" under heavy delay conditions, as claimed in the paper (Fig 2 mentioned in text).
