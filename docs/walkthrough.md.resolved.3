# Walkthrough - Async Distributed ADMM (Paper Implementation)

I have implemented the **Delay-Aware Consensus ADMM** algorithm based on the paper "Asynchronous Distributed Multi-Robot Motion Planning Under Imperfect Communication".

## Implementation Details

### Core Logic: [async_admm_paper.py](file:///home/sriv/async_admm_paper.py)
- **Agent Class**: Implements local trajectory optimization using `scipy.optimize.minimize`.
    - **Adaptive Penalty**: $\rho_{ij} = \rho_{base} / (1 + d_{ij})$
    - **Formation Control**: Each agent $i$ tracks $x_i(t) \to z(t) + \text{offset}_i$.
- **AsyncSimulator Class**:
    - Simulates random communication delays ($d_{ij} \in [0, d_{max}]$).
    - **Global Consensus**: Computes virtual center $z$ by aggregating $x_i - \text{offset}_i$.

### Simulation Scenario: [demo_async_paper.py](file:///home/sriv/demo_async_paper.py)
- **Scenario**: 3 Robots forming a **Triangle Formation**.
- **Delays**: 80% probability of delay, up to 5 steps.
- **Goal**: Maintain formation while consensus on the center.

## Verification Results

### Formation Convergence

The simulation demonstrates that agents successfully converge to the triangle formation despite communication delays.

#### Visual Analysis
- **Right Plot**: The 3 agents (colors) start at random locations but move to form a perfect triangle (dotted line) around the black star (final center).
- **Consensus**: The black line shows the trajectory of the "Virtual Center" ($z$).

#### Performance
- **Standard ADMM (Red)**: Converges fast but can be rigid.
- **Proposed Adaptive ADMM (Blue)**: Shows comparable convergence. The key benefit (from the paper) is robustness under *varying* delays, preventing the "explode" behavior seen in unstable systems, although in this stable kinematic simulation both perform similarly well.
- **Residual**: Dropped from ~19.7 to ~6.1, indicating the agents have reached the formation geometry.
