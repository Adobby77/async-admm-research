# Walkthrough - Async Distributed ADMM (Paper Implementation)

I have implemented the **Delay-Aware Consensus ADMM** algorithm based on the paper "Asynchronous Distributed Multi-Robot Motion Planning Under Imperfect Communication".

## Implementation Details

### Core Logic: [async_admm_paper.py](file:///home/sriv/async_admm_paper.py)
- **Agent Class**: Implements local trajectory optimization using `scipy.optimize.minimize`.
    - **Adaptive Penalty**: $\rho_{ij} = \rho_{base} / (1 + d_{ij})$
    - **Formation Control**: Each agent $i$ tracks $x_i(t) \to z(t) + \text{offset}_i$.
- **AsyncSimulator Class**:
    - Simulates random communication delays ($d_{ij} \in [0, d_{max}]$).
    - **Global Consensus**: Computes virtual center $z$ by aggregating $x_i - \text{offset}_i$.

### Simulation Scenario: Stress Test
- **Scenario**: 6 Robots forming a **Hexagon Formation**.
- **Delays**: High delay environment (Max 8 steps, 90% probability).
- **Goal**: Maintain formation under chaotic communication.

## Verification Results

### Stress Test Results

I ran a stress test with 6 agents and heavy delays.

#### Performance Analysis
- **Standard vs Adaptive**: Both methods managed to converge to the formation in this unconstrained kinematic simulation.
- **Why Standard didn't fail**: Since the underlying dynamics are simple (linear double integrator or single integrator in this verification) and the cost function is convex, Standard ADMM is surprisingly robust. The "Adaptive" benefit is most critical when:
    1.  The system is unstable or highly nonlinear (e.g., quadrotor dynamics).
    2.  There are hard constraints (collision avoidance) where jumping to an old position causes violations.
- **Formation Quality**: As seen in the right plot, the 6 agents successfully formed a Hexagon around the moving center.
